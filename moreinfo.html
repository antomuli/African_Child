            Children working at a young age has been a consistent theme throughout Africa. Many children began first
            working in the home to help their parents run the family farm.
            Children in Africa today are often forced into exploitative labour due to family debt and other financial
            factors, leading to ongoing poverty.

                Other types of domestic child labour
                include working in commercial plantations, begging, and other sales such as boot shining. In total,
                there is an estimated five million children who are currently working in the field
                of agriculture which steadily increases during the time of harvest. Along with 30 percent of children
                who are picking coffee, there are an estimated 25,000 school age children who work year round.
                What industries children work in depends on if they grew up in a rural area or an urban area. Children
                who were born in urban areas often found themselves working for street vendors, washing cars, helping in
                construction sites, weaving clothing, and sometimes even working as exotic dancers. While children who
                grew up in rural areas would work on farms doing physical labour, working with animals, and selling
                crops. Of all the child workers,
                the most serious cases involved street children and trafficked children due to the physical and
                emotional abuse they endured by their employers. To address the issue of child labour, the United
                Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child
                Act was implemented in 1959.
                Yet due to poverty, lack of education and ignorance, the legal actions were not/are not wholly enforced
                or accepted in Africa.
